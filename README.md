My journey of front-end web developer is getting excited and came across a very good book called Learn to Code HTML and CSS: Develop and Style Websites by Shay Howe.  An excellent book and teaches all concepts from basic to advance and this is what I came up with from this book. This website is responsive and it is best viewed on a computer or a laptop. This should not discourage you to click on the link as it is amazing. No use of Flex Box or CSS GRID, yet awesome website can be designed from this amazing book.  I have added bit of my own flair and the second phase now is to re-design this website using Flex Box and CSS GRID to make it fully responsive website.  Will post that soon.
